NEW STRATEGY: Label each pair of cards with the same number with a red and black dot on each. A player will immediately discard all of their cards until they receive a card with a red dot, at which point they will hold onto only that card until they find the corresponding card with a black dot.

QUESTION: Is it possible for the game to deadlock? If not, what condition of deadlock is not satisfied?","Circular wait is not satisfied here.

NEW STRATEGY: All players show their hand to all other players at all times. When a player draws a new card, they also check all other player hands - if either of the held cards are in someone else's hand, they ""steal"" the card from them and immediately win, discarding the remaining card.

QUESTION: Is it possible for the game to deadlock? If not, what condition of deadlock is not satisfied?",Preemption is allowed. Players can steal cards from each other without prompting

QUESTION: Is it possible for the game to deadlock? If not, what condition of deadlock is not satisfied?","No Hold and Wait. By designating that a player must evict the oldest card they are holding, it prevents them from hanging on to the same card indefinitely"

NEW STRATEGY: Instead of discarding a card, the player instead rips the card (or whatever is left of the card) in half, keeping half for themselves and discarding the other half. Each piece is considered the same as the full card itself when considering winning.

QUESTION: Is it possible for the game to deadlock? If not, what condition of deadlock is not satisfied?",Mutual exclusion is not satisfied. Multiple players are able to share a resource/card (by ripping it in half)

While it can be argued that this could result in an abort, as it is unrecoverable, it is important to note that the act of pausing the program to attempt to retrieve the data at the address of the nullptr is a fault in of itself.

15,Spoons Intro,180,No,- I have read the game rules (no points will be earned this round),1,"In the game of spoons, a player wins if they are holding 2 cards of the same number, and in each set of cards, there are only 2 cards of each number. There are at least as many card numbers as there are players in the game.

- Turns are unordered and untimed: players take a ""turn"" whenever they want to, and multiple turns can be taken at once. Assume that players will always take a turn if they are able to, but players may take different amounts of time to take a single turn.
- Each person starts with 1 card.
- A turn consists of draining some number of cards, and discarding some number of cards. By default, a player draws 1 card, bringing their hand to 2 cards, and if not winning immediately, discarding one of the 2 cards.
- A discarded card can be drawn by another player
- When a player ""wins"", they immediately stop playing, but other players may continue to play until they win
- Assume that players will follow a collective strategy, and will not deviate from it under any circumstances

By default, when a player draws a new card, they compare it to their existing card, and if it doesn't match, discard the card they just drew.

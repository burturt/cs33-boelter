NEW STRATEGY: All players show their hand to all other players at all times. When a player draws a new card, they also check all other player hands - if either of the held cards are in someone else's hand, they "steal" the card from them and immediately win, discarding the remaining card.

QUESTION: Is it possible for the game to deadlock? If not, what condition of deadlock is not satisfied?

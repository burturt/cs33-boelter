Assume our device has a direct mapped cache consisting of a single 64 byte block that is initially empty. Suppose we are running  a program that accesses the following memory addresses in order:

0x00000000
0x00000004
0x00000008
0x00000010
0x0000100C
0x00001008
0x00001004
0x00001000
0x00000FFC
0x00000FF8

What is our miss rate (in fractional form)?

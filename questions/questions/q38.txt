What is the value of a[3].u.one? Use the following memory dump and struct to locate the value. Input your answer in hexadecimal, like 0x1234. This is using the same struct from the previous question (hint: the struct is 32 bytes large). In order to save screen real estate and trees, you've recorded the gdb output on a google doc, available at https://tinyurl.com/wombo-combo-gdb.

struct myStruct
{
    short i;
    char c;
    union
    {
        int one;
        long two;
    } u;
    char s[10];
};

struct myStruct a[5];
